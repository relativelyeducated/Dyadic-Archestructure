# Contributing

## Goals
- **Neutrality:** Add data, not takes.
- **Traceability:** Every row needs a source tag.
- **Falsification:** Propose the strongest alternative for any high score.

## How to contribute
1. Fork and create a branch.
2. Add rows to ledgers (chronological, with `[Source, Date]`).
3. Adjust heatmap only if ≥2 independent sources support a change.
4. Include a short rationale in your PR.

## Review checklist
- **Source quality:** Primary or well‑corroborated secondary?
- **Scope fit:** Belongs in this event/domain?
- **Clarity:** Plain language; no insinuations.
- **Links:** Glossary terms linked on first use.
