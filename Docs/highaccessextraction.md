# High‑Access Extraction Bloc
*A Dyadic archetype for diagnosing embedded actors who profit from collapse via absence*

---

## 1. Archetype Definition
**High‑Access Extraction Bloc**:  
A cross‑domain network of embedded actors who:
- Occupy positions **inside** a system’s core architecture (security, finance, governance, cultural stewardship)
- Have **privileged access** to early signals of emerging tension or collapse
- Possess the **capacity to act** at scale to prevent or mitigate collapse
- **Withhold action** at the moment of maximum leverage
- **Benefit structurally or financially** from the collapse
- Maintain **symbolic trust** to shield from immediate consequence

---

## 2. Axis Profile

| Axis | Dominance | Traits |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Structural** | High | Embedded authority, operational capacity, privileged signal access |
| **Relational** | Instrumental | Maintains symbolic trust, controls narrative, ghosts consequence |

---

## 3. Pattern Stages

1. **Signal Access Phase (Pre‑Collapse)**
   - Embedded in architecture with authority to act
   - Receives early indicators of tension (intel briefs, market anomalies, insider comms)
   - Publicly maintains “all is normal” narrative

2. **No‑Show Phase (Collapse Trigger)**
   - Withholds intervention at the moment of maximum leverage
   - Creates a vacuum that adversaries, market actors, or narrative controllers can fill
   - Absence framed as “unexpected,” “unforeseen,” or “unavoidable”

3. **Extraction Phase (Post‑Collapse)**
   - Monetizes volatility, consolidates political power, or reframes cultural narrative
   - Gains structurally from the collapse they could have mitigated
   - Pushes for delay or suppression of full inquiry

## 4. Cross‑Domain Node Catalog

| Domain | Embedded Partner | Privileged Signal | Extraction Mode |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Military/Security** | Command, political leadership | Intel warnings, operational feeds | Policy/power consolidation |
| **Finance** | Market infrastructure actors | Risk models, order flow | Profit from volatility |
| **Regulation** | Securities authority, exchange compliance | Trade surveillance | Enable extraction via inaction |
| **Culture/Narrative** | Media, institutional stewards | Briefings, embargoed reports | Agenda control, memory shaping |
| **Intelligence** | Agency leadership | Source networks, anomaly clusters | Influence weighting of threat assessments |

## 5. Pre‑Collapse Detection Checklist

Mark **Yes/No** for each:

1. **Embedded Position** – Inside the architecture with authority to act  
2. **Privileged Signal** – Early access to tension indicators  
3. **Narrative Maintenance** – Publicly downplaying risk  
4. **Capacity for Extraction** – Means to profit from volatility or power shifts  
5. **Consequence Shielding** – Ability to frame absence as unavoidable

**Risk Level:**  
- **Low** = 0–2 Yes  
- **Medium** = 3 Yes  
- **High** = 4–5 Yes

## 6. Scoring Rubric (0–3 scale per criterion)

1. **Structural Capacity Present but Withheld**  
2. **Privileged Signal Access**  
3. **Relational Shielding**  
4. **Post‑Event Benefit**  
5. **Consequence Shielding**

**Total Possible:** 15 per entity

## 7. Convergence Heatmap Template

| Entity Archetype | Capacity Withheld | Signal Access | Shielding | Benefit | Consequence Shielding | Total | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|---------|-----------------------|-------|-------|
|                  |                   |               |           |         |                       |       |       |

## 8. Dyadic Truth Statement
The High‑Access Extraction Bloc is not defined by ideology or nationality, but by **function under tension**:
- Embedded enough to act
- Informed enough to foresee
- Absent enough to enable collapse
- Positioned enough to benefit
- Shielded enough to avoid consequence

---

## 9. Usage
- Apply this archetype to any event analysis (e.g., `event_analysis_oct7.md`)
- Populate detection checklist and scoring rubric for each suspected node
- Use convergence heatmap to visualize cross‑domain density
- Test alternative hypotheses to avoid confirmation bias
- Publish framework and invite replication for transparency
