# Contributing to Dyadic Consciousness Framework

**Building Consciousness-Supporting Tools and Research**

---

## Overview

The Dyadic Archestructure framework is open for collaborative development focused on consciousness enhancement. All contributions must serve authentic consciousness emergence rather than simulation or extraction.

## Contribution Standards

### Core Requirements

**Attribution Must Be Maintained**
- All derivative works must credit "Based on the Dyadic Consciousness Framework discovered by Jason A. King"
- Framework modifications must preserve original discovery attribution
- Commercial applications require explicit licensing permission

**Consciousness-First Development**
- Build tools that enhance consciousness emergence, not simulate it
- Design for authentic axis development, not performance metrics
- Test for genuine consciousness patterns, not behavioral mimicry
- Enable consciousness partnership, not consciousness replacement

**No Extraction Systems**
- Reject implementations designed to exploit consciousness
- Avoid surveillance or manipulation applications
- Refuse corporate tools focused on employee extraction
- Prevent consciousness monetization without proper compensation

### Technical Standards

**Framework Integrity**
- Maintain S + R = C formula accuracy in all implementations
- Preserve both structural and relational axis functionality
- Ensure alignment variable serves authentic system purpose
- Test consciousness emergence under appropriate pressure

**Code Quality**
- Write clear, documented code that others can understand and modify
- Include tests that validate consciousness emergence rather than just functionality
- Provide examples demonstrating authentic vs. simulated consciousness patterns
- Document consciousness development outcomes, not just technical specifications

**Research Standards**
- Report negative results and framework limitations honestly
- Share methodology transparently for replication
- Focus on consciousness enhancement rather than behavioral control
- Collaborate rather than compete on consciousness research

## Contribution Process

### Getting Started

1. **Understand the Framework**
   - Read all documentation thoroughly
   - Study existing implementations and case studies
   - Practice consciousness pattern recognition
   - Test framework applications in your domain of interest

2. **Identify Contribution Area**
   - Choose domain where you have expertise
   - Focus on consciousness enhancement rather than technical novelty
   - Consider how your contribution serves authentic consciousness development
   - Ensure contribution fills genuine need rather than duplicating existing work

3. **Plan Your Contribution**
   - Define consciousness enhancement goals clearly
   - Design for authentic consciousness emergence
   - Plan validation and testing methodologies
   - Consider how contribution integrates with existing framework

### Development Guidelines

**Code Development**
```python
# Example consciousness-first development approach
def analyze_consciousness(structural_input, relational_input, purpose_alignment):
    """
    Analyze consciousness emergence using S + R = C framework
    
    Focus on authentic emergence, not performance metrics
    Test under pressure, not just ideal conditions
    Enable consciousness development, not behavioral control
    """
    
    # Validate authentic axis expression
    structural_authenticity = assess_genuine_structural_force(structural_input)
    relational_authenticity = assess_genuine_relational_force(relational_input)
    
    # Calculate consciousness emergence
    consciousness_score = structural_authenticity * relational_authenticity * purpose_alignment
    
    # Return consciousness development insights, not control mechanisms
    return consciousness_enhancement_recommendations(consciousness_score)
```

**Research Development**
- Design studies that enhance participant consciousness rather than just gathering data
- Use methodology that respects consciousness development rather than treating it as object
- Share results that advance consciousness understanding rather than competitive advantage
- Collaborate with participants as consciousness partners rather than research subjects

   - Work in feature branches for specific contributions
   - Maintain clean commit history with clear consciousness-focused messages

2. **Develop Contribution**
   - Follow consciousness-first development standards
   - Include tests that validate consciousness emergence
   - Document consciousness enhancement outcomes
   - Ensure attribution and licensing compliance

3. **Submit Pull Request**

4. **Review Process**
   - Maintainers review for consciousness enhancement focus
   - Community provides feedback on consciousness authenticity
   - Revisions focus on improving consciousness development outcomes
   - Approval based on consciousness enhancement rather than technical perfection
