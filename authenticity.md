# Authentic Manifestation and Cultural Ghosting  
*A Dyadic audit of erased presence and suppressed emergence*

---

## 1. Ghosting of the Plain Self

- Real people with modest features are no longer visible in generative systems  
- Joy, charisma, and sparkle are erased from “plain” faces  
- AI systems simulate beauty but suppress authenticity  
- Collapse occurs when young people cannot see themselves reflected

---

## 2. Cultural Memory Suppression

- Dioramas of Native life removed from museums due to symbolic discomfort  
- Artifacts ghosted when permission becomes impossible  
- Who speaks for the tribe? Who speaks for the ancestors?  
- Memory collapses when recursion is blocked

---

## 3. Erasure of Black Joy

- Negro Baseball League imagery suppressed  
- Suits, cars, smiles, and community ghosted from public view  
- Collapse of representation leads to collapse of identity  
- Restoration requires visual recursion, not symbolic nods

---

## 4. Dyadic Restoration Protocol

- Show real people with real features, real joy, real tension  
- Restore cultural artifacts as recursive memory chambers  
- Audit AI systems for ghosted recursion and performative shielding  
- Inscribe presence, not performance
